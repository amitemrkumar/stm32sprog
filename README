stm32sprog is an in-system programming (ISP) utility for STM32
microcontrollers.  It relies on the STM32's built-in bootloader.

All STM32 microcontrollers have a built-in bootloader that can be used for ISP.
To activate it, pull the BOOT0 and BOOT1 pins high and low respectively, and
perform a reset.  The bootloader supports connections to USART1 on all devices.
Some devices also support connections to USART2.  See ST application notes
AN2606 and AN3155 for details.

stm32sprog requires a serial connection to the target device's USART.  A simple
option is to use a USB-to-USART converter.  If the serial hardware supports
modem control signals, the DTR signal can be used to automatically reset the
target device.
